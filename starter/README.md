Asteroid Radar is an app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth.
You can view all the detected asteroids in a period of time, their data (size, velocity, distance to Earth), and if they are potentially hazardous.

The app consists of two screens: A Main screen with a list of all the detected asteroids and a Details screen that is going to display the data of
that asteroid once itÂ´s selected in the Main screen list. The main screen will also show the NASA image of the day to make the app more striking.
