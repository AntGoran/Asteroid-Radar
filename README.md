Asteroid Radar 

The Asteroid Radar app is a project that is part of the Advanced Android with Kotlin course on the Udacity platform. It was developed as the final exam for the Developing Android Apps with Kotlin - Part 2 module.

Asteroid Radar is a mobile application that provides users with a visually appealing representation of asteroids detected by NASA as they approach Earth. By using this app, users can easily access information about all the detected asteroids within a specific time period. This includes important details such as the size, velocity, distance to Earth, and whether they are considered potentially hazardous.

The app consists of two screens:

    The Main screen acts as the central hub, presenting users with a comprehensive list of all the detected asteroids. Additionally, it showcases a captivating feature where the NASA image of the day is displayed, enhancing the overall appeal of the app.
    The Details screen offers a more detailed exploration of a selected asteroid from the Main screen list. Once a user chooses a specific asteroid, this screen provides in-depth data about that particular asteroid.

To create this app, various technologies and frameworks were utilized. These include ViewModel, Room, LiveData, DataBinding, and Navigation. The app fetches data from the NASA NeoWS (Near Earth Object Web Service) API to provide the asteroid information to the users.
